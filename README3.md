# Resistor Value Lookup

*Short Story:*
	I wanted a bare-bones, internet-free resistor lookup. 

*Long Story:*
	Two weeks earlier I had learned enough Clojure to start making simple programs and was energized by its expressiveness. I was making everything I could into a code project, out of pure joy. The language  greatly improved my programming and was too fun, so I've been running with it ever since.
